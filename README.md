# 🧩 Short Python Projects Collection

A collection of **small Python mini-projects and games** built for **practice, learning, and experimentation**.
Each project focuses on a specific concept such as logic building, loops, conditionals, user input handling, APIs, or basic automation.

This repository serves as a **learning playground** and a **portfolio of hands-on Python practice**.
